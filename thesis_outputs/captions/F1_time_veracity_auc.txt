Figure F1 tests RQ(2): whether early geometry improves veracity prediction under early-warning time limits. Each point is mean AUC from 5-fold Stratified CV at T={30,60,180} minutes, with shaded +/-1 SD. Baseline uses early volume/timing only; Full adds early tree geometry (depth, width, branching, leaves, entropy, virality). The dashed line marks average Full performance across windows. N_used per window is shown on the x-axis and should be considered when interpreting uncertainty.
