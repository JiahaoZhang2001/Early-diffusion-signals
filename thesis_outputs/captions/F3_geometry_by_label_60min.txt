Figure F3 provides mechanistic evidence at T=60 minutes by comparing early geometry across veracity labels. The two panels show leaf_fraction and structural_virality_proxy distributions with median lines. Visible shifts in these geometry features between false and non-false cascades support the claim that shape differs early. This complements predictive metrics by showing interpretable structural differences rather than model output alone.
