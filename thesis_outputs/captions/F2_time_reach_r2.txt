Figure F2 tests RQ(1): whether early geometry improves eventual reach prediction (target log(1+final_size)). Points show mean R² from 5-fold CV with +/-1 SD shading across time windows. Comparing Baseline vs Structure-only vs Full isolates the incremental value of geometry beyond early volume/timing. The dashed benchmark reports the overall Full average across windows. Coverage and N_used constrain which early-warning settings are practically informative.
